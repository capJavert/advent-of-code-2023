# Advent of Code 2023

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!
### Update #2: Caught up with the first 2 days, day 1 was cool, never used "lookahead" and match index manipulation before in regex. Also finally made a proper puzzle input fetcher this year, only took my lazy ass 6 years üòÇ
### Update #3: While I don't want to use AI to solve puzzles I am using GitHub Copilot Chat to parse the puzzle inputs. It is cool because it involves describing the input and its structure in simple terms. üçø
### Update #4: First week of AoC is done and dusted. Ppuzzles varied in complexity but I would say all of them so far were pretty solid and interesting. So far so good. 
### Update #5: First harder day for me, did a lot of traveling this weekend and just an eventful couple of days in general.. icing on the cake today's puzzle had a geography problem. Part two had a [Jordan Curve Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem) which after some research and Reddit time I implemented partially to get the solution.
