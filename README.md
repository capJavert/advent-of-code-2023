# Advent of Code 2023

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!
### Update #2: Caught up with the first 2 days, day 1 was cool, never used "lookahead" and match index manipulation before in regex. Also finally made a proper puzzle input fetcher this year, only took my lazy ass 6 years 😂
### Update #3: While I don't want to use AI to solve puzzles I am using GitHub Copilot Chat to parse the puzzle inputs. It is cool because it involves describing the input and its structure in simple terms. 🍿
### Update #4: First week of AoC is done and dusted. Ppuzzles varied in complexity but I would say all of them so far were pretty solid and interesting. So far so good. 
### Update #5: First harder day for me, did a lot of traveling this weekend and just an eventful couple of days in general.. icing on the cake today's puzzle had a geography problem. Part two had a [Jordan Curve Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem) which after some research and Reddit time I implemented partially to get the solution.
### Update #6: 16th day of AOC already! Going well so far, today's problem was closest to the ray-tracing I'll ever get 😂 it involved shooting some recursive beams around the grid with a bunch of mirrors. The hardest thing was preventing beams from reflecting infinitely. 
### Update #7: Xmas is closing up and so is AoC. Currently sitting at 38/42 stars. 17th day I was not able to solve and today and the 19th day I only did part 1. They mostly involved some figuring out and analyzing the inputs. This year there were hardly any puzzles that could be solved by brute-forcing, part 2 was always more complex and required correct logical thinking and understanding of the core problem. 💪 Still going strong though and let's see how many more I can solve this year. 
### Update #8: At least I managed to solve all the Xmas gifts 😂
### Update #9: Merry Xmas, 38 stars this year, not great not terrible, see ya next year! 🍻 (I might tackle few more challenges later)
