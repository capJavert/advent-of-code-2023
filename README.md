# Advent of Code 2023

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!
### Update #2: Caught up with the first 2 days, day 1 was cool, never used "lookahead" and match index manipulation before in regex. Also finally made a proper puzzle input fetcher this year, only took my lazy ass 6 years 😂
### Update #3: While I don't want to use AI to solve puzzles I am using GitHub Copilot Chat to parse the puzzle inputs. It is cool because it involves describing the input and its structure in simple terms. 🍿
### Update #4: First week of AoC is done and dusted. Ppuzzles varied in complexity but I would say all of them so far were pretty solid and interesting. So far so good.
